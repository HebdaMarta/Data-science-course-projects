## General info
This GitHub repository contains code samples that demonstrate analysis of the data contained in the database Medical Cost Personal Datasets. The sample includes scripts that can be used to explore the data in python in this database. The purpose of the model was to predict the amount of insurance costs depending on individual features (regression models).

## Structure

The table, which contains 7 columns, is designed to hold data in the CSV and answer questions about the data using python. Columns:
- age: age of primary beneficiary
- sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
- bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
- objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
- children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
- smoker: Smoking
- region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
- charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance


- Activities done: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, Data Analysis,
- Technology Used: Python, Machine learning models for regression (Random forest, XGboost, SVR, LinearRegression, KNN)
- Authors: Hebda Marta, Maj Wojciech, Marciniak Elżbieta, Pich Filip.
